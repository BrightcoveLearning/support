        <p>PHP Wrapper for Brightcove Dynamic Ingest</p>
        <p>This project provides a starting point for integrating the Brightcove Dynamic Ingest API into your application. It provides simple ways to add and update videos and associated media using either pull-based ingest or source file upload.</p>

      <!-- <li>
		<p>PHP Wrapper for Brightcove Dynamic Ingest</p>
	
		<p>This Python script uses Media API to find all videos that have old style captions (ttml, dfxp) downloads the caption files and uses pycaption to convert them to WebVTT captions. It then uses the Source File Upload API for Dynamic Ingest to get an S3 bucket, push the webvtt files to the S3 bucket, and then makes Dynamic Ingestion calls to add the WebVTT captions to the correct video.</p>
	
		<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note that if your account is configured for Dynamic Delivey, it is not necessary to convert DFXP captions to WebVTT yourself - if you ingest the DFXP captions using the Dynamic Ingest API, we will convert them to WebVTT automatically. See <a href="/node/17938#adding_srt_dfxp">Ingesting WebVTT Files (Text Tracks/Captions)</a> for more details.</aside>

        <p>API Facade</p>
        <p>This humble library aims to be a simple facade over Brightcove's server APIs. As the mob demands additional functionality, it will be added here.</p>

        <p>Player Management API Client</p>

        <p>Brightcove APIs Examples using CSharp</p>
        <p>This project shows how the new Brightcove APIs can be used with C#.</p>
        <p>Please note that this will work from desktop environments (tested), but will probably not work if used in ASP.NET pages due to CORS. If you run into this problem I believe the only way to solve this is to use the PHP proxy provided by Brightcove in all their CMS API example pages.</p>
        <p>All code is provided as-is and purely as example. Use it at your own risk. No support is provided for it in any way, form or shape.</p>
