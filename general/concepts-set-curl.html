  <h1>Concepts: Set up cURL</h1>
  <summary>In this topic, you will learn about cURL, a tool useful for testing and making API requests. cURL is a command line tool for making HTTP requests. We use cURL in a <a href="/node/17925#bc-ipnav-2">shell script for testing Brightcove API calls</a>. If you are on Mac MacOS or any Unix/Linux system, you already have cURL. If you are on Windows, see instructions below for getting cURL.</summary>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="windows" class="notranslate">Windows</h2>
    <p>If you have <span class="notranslate">Windows</span>, you can download and install cURL as follows.</p>
    <h3>Installing cURL</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>In <span class="notranslate">Windows</span>, create a new folder called <strong>curl</strong> in your C: drive.</p>
        <p><code>C:curl</code></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Go to <a href="//cygwin.com/install.html">https://cygwin.com/install.html</a> follow the instructions there, choosing the 32-bit or 64-bit installer according to the system you have. During the install you will be prompted for packages to install. Open the Net package, then check the <strong>curl</strong> option and then finish the installation.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <!-- <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">If you need more guidance on setting up curl on <span class="notranslate">Windows</span>, see <a href="https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203691436-Installing-and-using-cURL#install">this</a> document.</aside> --></section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="testSetup">Test your setup</h2>
    <p class="language-editable">To run <code>cURL</code> commands, you just type curl (with appropriate flags for the request you want to make) at the Terminal or DOS prompt, and then pressing Return. To make sure cURL is correctly installed, open a Terminal or DOS window, type <code>curl</code> at the prompt, and press Return. You should see a message like this:</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
<span class="notranslate">
  <code class="language-bash">curl: try 'curl --help' or 'curl --manual' for more information</code></span></pre>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="sendData">Sending Data</h2>
    <p>If you need to send data with the API request (as in a POST or PATCH request, for example), there are several ways to do it. You can include the data inline or in a separate file. Here is a Player Management API example submitting the data as a separate JSON file:</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
<span class="notranslate">
  <code class="language-bash">curl --request POST
    --url https://players.api.brightcove.com/v2/accounts/57838016001/players
    --header 'authorization: Bearer <span class="bcls-input">YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE</span>'
    --header 'content-type: application/json'
    <span class="bcls-highlight">--data <strong>&lt;</strong>player_data/player_config.json</span> </code></span></pre>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--info">Note the "&lt;" symbol, which sends the file contents. Use this rather than the "@" symbol, which attaches the file as an upload.</aside>
